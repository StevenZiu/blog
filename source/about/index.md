Hi there, this is __Steven__. I am really glad to have you here! 

I graduate from Hong Kong Polytechnic University with master degree in the Computer Science in the 2016. I currently work as a fullstack developer in the South China Morning Post, before joining SCMP I work as a Software Engineer in the ANX International.

I hava strong interest to research related technologies in the JavaScript family, and the compile theory of JavaScript. Besides, I also code in Python and Golang. I would like to try more projects in the coming year.

Let's keep going and carry on!
